## OpenWrt devices PoV

This is basically a copy of the great [LineageOS
wiki](https://wiki.lineageos.org/) filled with data of the great
[OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org) project. Small adaptions were made due to
different devices types.

The [scraper.py] script converts the [OpenWrt table of
hardware](https://openwrt.org/toh/start) to `yaml` files, beeing then processed
by `jekyll`.

This is just a *proof of concept* how the current OpenWrt documentation could be
simplified.
